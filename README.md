# NutriSync X Alexa
An anywhere convenience approach to nutrition tracking and health.

Nutrisync X Alexa uses Amazon Alexa as a convenient source of nutritional information and data. Whether trying to bulk up or slim down, Alexa can assist you with all your nutritional needs via a food database and lambda functions to help her help you! This project aims to expand the ideas of applications and websites to bring those interactive user interfaces to a vocalized pocket device. 

This project includes a website designed to bring awareness to its purpose, an application to generate a sample UI for nutrition apps like MyFitnessPal, and an Alexa Skill to focus on nutritional data.

Languages: JavaScript, React, Python, HTML, CSS

For the prototype, no API was implemented, but plans to implement MyFitnessPal database API are in the works.
